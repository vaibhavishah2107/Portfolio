# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean, responsive design with theme toggle, smooth scrolling, and mobile-friendly navigation. The site highlights my skills (HTML, CSS, JS, C++, Python), showcases several projects, and has contact details. Perfect for sharing my work and getting in touch.
